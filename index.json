For example, we can rename it to docs for software/project documentation or tutorials for creating an online course.\nDelete tutorials To remove these pages, delete the courses folder and see below to delete the associated menu link.\nUpdate site menu After renaming or deleting the courses folder, you may wish to update any [[main]] menu links to it by editing your menu configuration at config/_default/menus.toml.\nFor example, if you delete this folder, you can remove the following from your menu configuration:\n[[main]] name = \u0026quot;Courses\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;courses/\u0026quot; weight = 50  Or, if you are creating a software documentation site, you can rename the courses folder to docs and update the associated Courses menu configuration to:\n[[main]] name = \u0026quot;Docs\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;docs/\u0026quot; weight = 50  Update the docs menu If you use the docs layout, note that the name of the menu in the front matter should be in the form [menu.X] where X is the folder name. Hence, if you rename the courses/example/ folder, you should also rename the menu definitions in the front matter of files within courses/example/ from [menu.example] to [menu.\u0026lt;NewFolderName\u0026gt;].\n","date":1536451200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1536451200,"objectID":"59c3ce8e202293146a8a934d37a4070b","permalink":"https://gdobbels.github.io/courses/example/","publishdate":"2018-09-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/courses/example/","section":"courses","summary":"Learn how to use Academic's docs layout for publishing online courses, software documentation, and tutorials.","tags":null,"title":"Overview","type":"docs"}]
